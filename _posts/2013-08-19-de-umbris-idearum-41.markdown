# Translation

Merlin the Artist

It was he who painted roosters and hens  
He who, since he was not altogether unfoolish,  
and by whom, verily, foolish men were not able to be guided to more serious topics  
who spake thus, the artist, to the fool that  
He had sent away his servants and his hangers-on;  
through these deeds he wished that his charges be set far away.  

When you will no longer be ignorant of this, have fear  
until you hasten a true rooster into the paintings,  
you whom they make to bewonder pennies:  
Let you not sorrow at having been driven from a foolish master.

# Original

_cf. p42._


    Merlinus Artifex - GIODARNO BRUNO

    Est qui depinxit gallos gallinaceos
    Qui, quoniam non est omnino imprudens,
    quo non sic gravius deprehendi possint
    Tractus inepti, de inepto artista:
    Servulos ordinavit, et amiculos;
    Per quos vult naturales procul abigi.

    Hoc cum non ignoraveris, timeto
    Dum verus gallus in pictos approperas,
    Qui faciunt mirari auriculatos:
    Ne importuno ministro abactus, doleas.

## Meaning

Merlin is a trickster figure.  He tells those who could not extract
greater things from his lessons that he sent away his servants and
friends; counting on these fools to do the same.

Therefore you who have heard this, let you be afraid until you manage to
make the drawn images real, you who are driven to accept nuggets of
wisdom, don't be surprised when a fool (following Merlinus' advice)
dismisses you.

Bruno probably knew of Merlin as a wizard's name.  I think he means that
his astounding memory techniques lead some (the patron Henry III) to
regard him as a wizard. He is not, but those who thought him such (his
antagonists in the Church?) persecuted him for being such.  He mocks
them for being fools and says that wise people of any intelligence
should not be suprised or sad when said fools send them away.
