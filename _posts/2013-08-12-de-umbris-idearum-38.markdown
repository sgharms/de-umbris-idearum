## To Henry III

### The most serene, the King of the French and Poles, etc.

#### Philotheus Giodarno Bruno of Nola

Who does not know, most sacred Majesty, that first principles are
dervied from the first things, the more essential principles from
greater things, and the most essential principle from the greatest
thing?  Let no one, therefore, wonder why this work of yours -- which
bends itself around the highest of subject, which gives support to one
with the remarkableness of its invention, and through which it is
communicated that it is to be numbered among the greatest things --
bears back to you -- you who are the great spectacle of the people, and
who is most outstanding in virtuous character, and who is most
celebrated with the sublimnity of the height of his genius, and who is
therefore most keen and magnanimus and learned of all things --
heartfelt respect in humble bounds.  This very work is yours to acccept
from a favored soul, to regard with great favor, and to examine with
mature judgement in order that you be seen as more eminently generous,
powerful and also wise.

Be well
