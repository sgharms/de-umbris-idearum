DE VUMBRIS IDEARVM
==================

This project aims to produce an English translation Giodarno Bruno's "DE VMBRIS IDEARVM" ("On the shadows of ideas").

DE TRANSLATORE
==============

* I took 5 semesters of Latin
* I *do not* have a degree in it
* I am likely to be extremely slow at this
* I *do* have some background in philosophy and 16-17th c. philosophy of science
* I greatly admire Bruno and detest the Church's immolation of him
* I hope to share Bruno's genius with more people

CAVEAT BRVNI
============

Bruno was a very erudite human, to wit:
He memorized (thanks to the techniques he enumerates here) *most* of the Classical literary canon.  He can drop *literally* thousands of references.  Know the story of [Deucalion][]?  Who fathered the child of [Semele][]?
He was *also* a religious scholar so was up on all the religious references and themes of the time.  He was *also* a neo-Platonist mystic who inherited the knowledge of symbols, rites, and eccentricities of the Pythagorean and neo-Platonic movements.  It's near impossible to know what symbols or phrases had an *extra* layer of meaning not available to me.

MODVS
=====

I will create a page-per-page translation of the downloadable version.  I will then translate the sentences with my reasoning.  Hopefully **when** (not if) I err my logic will be documented **and** someone who knows better will be able to submit a pull request or make an amendment.

OPERE
=====

This is *not* a research-grade ready translation.  It's probably not fit to cite or refer to reliably.
